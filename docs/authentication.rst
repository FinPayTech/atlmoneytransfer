Authentication
==============

Authentication to the API is performed via bearer auth (e.g., for a cross-origin request), use -H "Authorization: Bearer sandbox_5ba22ce43aa945ba22ce43ab3b"

All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over plain HTTP will fail. API requests without authentication will also fail.
