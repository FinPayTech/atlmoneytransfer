Authentication
==============

Authentication to the API is performed via bearer auth (e.g., for a cross-origin request), use header

.. code-block:: console

  Authorization: Bearer sandbox_5ba9df637e1cd5baxxxxxxxxxx


All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over plain HTTP will fail. API requests without authentication will also fail.
